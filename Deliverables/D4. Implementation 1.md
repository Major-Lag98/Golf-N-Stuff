### 1. Introduction
Golf-N-Stuff is a browser-based mini golf simulator that allows office workers and gamers to slack off more efficiently without the need to worry. Having a free minigolf game right in your browser makes it all the more convenient to hide your office shenanigans from prying eyes. With our intuitive and realistic golf controls it makes you feel like you are actually hitting the ball! Golf-N-Stuff offers a realistic and sophisticated golf ball physics system that will leave you in awe as you thwack the ball across the range. The creative level design we hand crafted will keep you captivated through the twists and turns of each course while you procrastinate other important tasks. Lastly with our advanced menu design and quality of life features you can easily pick up a new game or start a specific level. It’s so easy, even a toddler can play.\

### 3. Tests 

+ 3.1.1:
  + We have utilized NUnit testing framework for the C# .NET language. We also utilize TestTools derived from the UnityEngine library to assist in the execution of tests in their respective environment.
+ 3.1.2:
  + [A link to the tests](https://github.com/Major-Lag98/Golf-N-Stuff/tree/main/Assets/Tests)
+ 3.1.3:
  + An example test case would be testing to see if the correct state change has occured when requested through code. [Here](https://github.com/Major-Lag98/Golf-N-Stuff/blob/main/Assets/Tests/PlayMode/TestStateChange.cs) is an example of where we do such a thing.
+ 3.1.4:
  + In the bottom right of the screen you can see the Unity Test Runner executing a test to assure that any updates passed to the UI display correctly work.

Golf-N-Stuff is a web based video game. We are deploying our system by using itch.io. Itch.io is an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on video games. This platform gave us the tools to make choices about how we can distrubite our game, access to analytics, and the use of a dashboard.

### 9. Look & Feel 

We wanted golf and stuff to be a more relaxing  and fun game that you can play while your bored and have nothing to do. For the look we wanted to appeal to that so we have a  more simplistic looking UI with a more cartoony looking tracks. The feel of the game is to try and keep it nice and peaceful with some lofi music playing along side you. We also implented a little putter that will appear when you want to hit the ball. So when you move your mouse to swing you can put your own power into you swing.

### 10. Lessons Learned

Our team overall learned how to correctly implement object oriented programming to create a decent game using Unity and C# as our main techknowledgies. Throught the development we figured out how to more efficently colaborate through clean code practices and version controll. During our initial development of the first release, it went well overall. We have initaly attempted to implement a 3rd party kanban board Trello and have learned it was difficult to maintain because we only meet once a week. So going forward we have discarded that techknowledgy and stuck with github issue boards.
